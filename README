TestFixtures
============

Adds a unit test called "fixtures_test" which confirms each of your fixtures are valid. 

Just run:

rake test:units
  or
ruby test/units/fixtures_test.rb


Example Output

If your test fails, you will get an error message such as:

$ ruby test/unit/fixtures_test.rb

Credits
=======

Much of the code is from an rspec test case. I found it somewhere out there on the internet, but I can't remember where. Credit goes to that guy. I just tweaked it to remove the rspec dependency, and enhanced the failure reporting.
